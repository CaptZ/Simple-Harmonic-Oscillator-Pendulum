# Simple-Harmonic-Oscillator-Pendulum
Numerical Simulation of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator Pendulum using three different numerical methods for comparison. 

This MATLAB script simulates a simple, undamped harmonic oscillator pendulum using three different numerical methods: Euler, Euler-Cromer, and Runge-Kutta method. It compares methods to each other and the analytical solution by calculating:
- Position Θ (Radian)
- Velocity Ω (Radian/s)
- Energy J (Joules)
- Error percentage % difference from the analytical solution
- The script also includes a phase plot for the all methods and the analytical solution
